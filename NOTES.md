- No logic in CLI
- Built out the classes I would need for gem
- Looked at Avi's gem video for direction because was unsure how to connect all my files for interaction
- Began building functionality
- Looked at example https://github.com/dannyd4315/worlds-best-restaurants-cli-gem/ listed in CLI-gem readme for structure
- Restructured gem and added more functionality to cli
